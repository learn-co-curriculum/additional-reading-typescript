# TypeScript

## Introduction

As we've mentioned before, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages
and will continue to be as long as it is critical to web development. Being fully comfortable in
vanilla JavaScript is very beneficial, so keep building projects with it if you still feel you
need practice. If you feel comfortable with your JS skills and are looking for a new challenge,
one option available is to explore [TypeScript][].

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by MicroSoft. What we mean by superset is that
programs written in JavaScript are also valid TypeScript programs. Programs written _in
TypeScript_ get transcompiled into JavaScript when run, similar to how Babel transcompiles
ES6 JavaScript into a backwards compatible version of the language.

TypeScript includes stricter syntax than vanilla JavaScript. Because of this additional syntax, it is
easier to spot errors in your code _before_ running it, particularly if you use an IDE like VS
Code (also developed by MicroSoft). 

## Getting Started with TypeScript

To get started with TypeScript, check out the [official documentation][typescript doc] for some
initial tutorials. Udemy also has a free [Introduction to TypeScript][] course that covers th
basics. For a more in depth exploration, check out the [TypeScript Deep Dive][]. Besides these options,
there are also many free tutorials available online.
